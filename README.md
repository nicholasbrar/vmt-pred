# Household Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) Prediction

Using only household features, the model initially achieved an R2 of around .05, improved  with winsorization and additional vehicle/person data to around .08. Rose to .57 when log-transforming the target. The model can capture proportional difference well but its accuracy in predicting absolute milage is somewhat limited.
